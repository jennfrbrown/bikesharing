## Overview of the statistical analysis
### Purpose of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. One of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis, as such the following illustrations were created.

Visualizations shown in this analysis include:
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

These visualizations will be used in a final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
